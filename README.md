# TopologicalMapper

This a code for our Topological Mapper project that is set out to collect data using a distance sensor mounted on top of a cart that rolls over the specific table surface.

This repository contains code that we will use to visualize and collect our data.

We plan on collecting our data using VEX V5 Brain Module, and we will visualize it with Python code that will display that.
